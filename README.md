# Toy Search 

This is the front end layer of a toy search web application, using React.js and React-Bootstrap.

The application was a group project for an accelerated learning program, with three days of teaching on React.js as a basis.

This repository owner was primarily responsible for the front end development. Full technological stack of the application consisted of Node.js (web-scraping data from toy store websites), Elasticsearch (search engine and data storage as a noSQL database), Spring Boot (intermediating layer), React.js (user interface).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
